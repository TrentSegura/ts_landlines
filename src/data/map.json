A community baseball team called the Chama Kitos sold game tickets to raise money under the direction of Father Onofre Martorell. It has a single-story cruciform plan with an eastern nave entrance. It is significant for Hispanic Heritage and was used as a religious center and social gathering location for the Chama community. In the summer months a priest from the Sangre de Cristo Parish conducts a Mass, in Spanish, at each local mission church in the area. The community still gathers at the church during Holy Week before carrying a model of the church to San Luis for religious observances.

The property was used as a lodge hall for the Hispanic labor union from the time it was built until recently. The S.P.M.D.T.U. is still an active organization in Colorado and Northern New Mexico. The organization was founded to provide mutual aid to its members by pooling their resources to assist one another in times of need.

There are approximately fifteen calderas known in the San Juan Volcanic Fields.<br><br>The region began with many composite volcanoes that became active between 35 and 40 million years ago and were particularly eruptive in the time period around 35-30 million years ago. Around this time the activity changed to explosive ash-flow eruptions.

It, along with fellow bicentennial neighbor Cottonwood Peak, anchors the north-central Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Reigning proudly from its position on the range crest, it's the tallest mountain in the Sangres north of Rito Alto Peak. <br><br>Far from the fourteeners which draw so many to the area, you can find peace and isolation here. Among Major Creek's highlights are groves of tall aspen, numerous beaver ponds, some of which have redirected water onto the trail or even overtaken the trail entirely, and a small natural arch.

The valleys between the plateaus are mostly a winterfat/blue grama short-grass shrub-steppe that provides good habitat for Gunnison prairie dogs.

It sits in the middle of the 77,000-acre Cielo Vista Ranch. Anyone who wants to climb it must make a reservation, show up at the ranch gate promptly at 6 a.m. and present a check to the owner FOR $150.<br><br>While there are plenty of wildflowers down low, you're close to a desert - this mountain is more New Mexico than it is Colorado. Expect lots of pika and marmots, and be prepared for a bear sighting.<br><br>MORE INFO:<br><br>https://www.aspentimes.com/news/colorado-14er-for-sale-buy-culebra-peak-in-the-sangre-de-cristo-range-for-105-million/<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA2ZQX4wKWvK5wwDWRnT8JSwJ1UdEvH02gv65GnZQi9EOsgRyrqzGYL5Z4yE_rItzajNRWOym6tX9IFQWz2RoSb-lQvlpAKMw2OqS-naIDPkb-cPbMgoPsN-yIo_gt3d8UjUb8XPiRA3p9iajH-BoJXdxhh2h4-Sxq6UcChYQ6FHpGHNRgz7hoH3s_zP__y28bF_Nfy4DxK_gBldjX67Bb95TqIWVs9c8L4bpzeOdM05kIA608Bxb-vwrxQuvBG1vP-ZNWAWzcc0wehPJFp2n6C2RN9RZ4vmKS4AG1_plpOhirAXZoXpmhwVVn5MM-jyM25rsIu1eujojkK6_Bv0BDULQrU2OWS8qpINZydOybYa9fD81Tdpo4wuwMrPSTUPG9nvHfZDO7KfZQjLyKXlk52He52tzwvV8SaWz4GHGTXxxXAp05FSyHfXHFLQB0mfdllx4cY6WJgH1UggQU1z4uDri0_j3T3fItLav5wNYyyNk0Lt6uMY2V5u_pXxRrR_u3_1jOY6RTdZVSu4tpwwc3RyuRqgWLSWXg0QY44A9Nlx9v4BW4Ou-po-pEbeKMNxcWjn73UOjl65xlgND1Z7h7IKyRbG5Lj-4rcywTBxoIvHduTi8c5lfPhBIl6fXQyItAo_cMySJcEUrMBZ7mZ5f60B31OsmesJmXrUkn8swMCWcgiE5ZkksTdI2q4tRbsUHhiVC6vE7Hus\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA0P9CKM8H_2p7xc7yRQ6XbIJ457bb9me4SnQZLtY2cFR9VSCBEdkWMK_uh8QFw4gLHaxjdSRJjFOIOkAup9nbpYAm47cdQyWBpmK8tMu1NT2EI5VnK_w7wKEgw5wQczZVu-fPOmbsT06CCaWNhsiowNQQYxh-nG3-s9ZsU_HW68Av5rSW6s4a0NQj_c80EER4swmbJjDH6trJaFatRJ-I6T5YuuYdmhOQHyVZ35sJgIXN5xlLbYmQpzWdYJquX1LufhqALlyGsF9kQJDi7QV0HkISAGU3h8T63_2i-mdLdU_7cv22uGuZBATFaeZuYBNxI3Sq0KQ0dhWK_43Xqw_yuJETX_7B0o9Yk7pbVWmJdhlSmnrt-SSvEJumI5HuAzMrFgrOWNoxXODoQrtHzHcrmOTxBZH0AWAa39-TWo0oXCVxGMNbyGe_mNUphnOqX4a95Q14HJEtHd0OepFlGHueX3M9_jxHWole9EKH6HQ4pNYSCq_9o161Hb708g4iEA-kxppWWcbdOyKEuAqwTVwFJWUK9BiSHnBIFo-eBzA_YFA2RsV6ng2lFhcnr186_zuwTPoE5GDAGP_mIni9Y_Ke-0us6_WYlEUfNOevQDEPaTSP8foxgnkFu9x_Wc5jUcrJS_jgRnRJD4Wv1-tlEbfmnSX0yKM-MUko0xjgFaKxjWihuYmAYauxxdAYK1a0N6WjEdl9CqBN9G\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />"

It is about 11 miles (18 km) northeast of Alamosa on County Road 25. The wetlands had been completely destroyed by pumping and diversion of water for irrigation. Starting in 1965 the Bureau of Land Management began to restore them, and they have become an increasingly important ecological habitat for shorebirds, waterbirds and other wildlife and native plants.<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA0F_xsSAt1_WZ5tSxcvM_qTvSDZbOKWo9p2q-l_affUoPzm3XDaEALQlUJ6ba3RgTQsAqhAcdoFv7Ik5ANErgI7XyO49YkmTFLYeMzzFOtUtSP6HZLkrvesDjZ6GQ3hFvs3QLHZ65Flx77VVoe845MbVbz7NkHAcQNLmu7dfTh5z4C0EdyCk7eKj2ummUKabQf0_vuM8XqoWtCf5qW7chAl4e8Vm2Pt7E3Yh8CirUex6nSQzz01b1BpFUMsJ7hGbV2a6Go2XV6OLzT3ptF8smY8zwRt-ATO8O-DVSvCgBsfgT8Rbr8xBMSoPuz02mGu-U-nRWMuOJR-O5YmpSRVyzF4LvUcSO1STbCwQw9vppQhHEsgIPh-ZiAYsWBQi3y5mLJ9j7j9rFFuBeYHGxGY17dXYM58iUdyVwsnXBpw3CCTC3WS2s4Lt1ZDUp9yBzWamh1OSGgcJgbZF3695ryPKAoTIpsyUMCV-E-U4X_SW7UggtYAb9VuPG-m_kCu8kNRqAT6n9OuhBHr8_tWROascCrf-cNFz3q7xC8JEH_Hyvn9qnwOHt652vL7AuCeQWMYppOXtg9VK7l1o3F02az6SbEnvfYjRPMPdfPAHTE-ryot4lz3xTyKw9HA1auCn5cd7Jywwy5TagfjnJ9NVIt3TM9sZrrzpci4UL_JTfCcyJaAx7c-aeevXcqz4dLx9bzbYWYb8strjnheyQ02XQe3d8pWuPmCWw1RJbT0o98zMMXeJgx26_c18J73RfdTxeGANjDvCYENvt0samHNAem1JnjfVXjSns3fNISONxxr_4pWuAfoeGI07_1ViQA4rbv2DCaX34Z9gKFH9BQZ4FiLe2lADAERTBohjGdx8ThIzm2SfMPIo1zXAuGDwsZRsHuBSO73e8XOtTNMflW3hQVMdTXtjcUMOv54vOb7AXzOhlh_WLZJ_ym11Q7agb-l8jtYhrsqi9jJbRzyUCl5pjsf0DjuWuhvUx5FsF0NTS-uyETJeOsBVfc8iw1fURVdUEKOj7rSeQ\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />"

It is one of the many turquoise deposits which was actively mined by Native Americans for centuries. I.P. King rediscovered the mine in 1890, and the King family has operated it ever since. It was originally called the Lick Skillet Mine. The Manassa turquoise mine produces an incredibly wide range of colors and qualities, from deep emerald greens to deep sky-blue. The best stones feature a rich golden-brown matrix with some spider-webbing.<br><br>The mine is not currently active, so Manassa turquoise is quite rare on today's market.<br><br>https://www.mindat.org/loc-6088.html"

Irrigation includes numerous dikes and other water control structures that provide water to a patchwork of diverse wetland habitats ranging from shallow wet meadows to open water. The refuge includes Artesian wells, pumped wells and irrigation canals, some dating to the \"ditch boom\" of the 1880s. <br><br>The refuge is a major stopover for migrating greater sandhill cranes moving between their wintering area around Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico and breeding grounds in the northern United States and southern Canada. Up to 20,000 cranes pass through in the spring and again in the fall. Three remaining endangered whooping cranes from a failed attempt to establish a wild migratory population in the 1980s can be seen migrating with their foster species, the sandhill crane. <br><br>Beginning in the l980s, a herd of elk began using the refuge. At present, several hundred elk may be seen on the refuge seeking winter food and sanctuary from hunting pressure on nearby public lands.<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA11kRkQ3-4QN1K1MdLzLb2dDi3TPNTHxMgAtA-rbI2h8CD3vr0xaQegAx--f2eGrE-IKh2dRqrOsJPjBPr3SkZebYZHdbAIrf2Zu4QRZHLkX7pG_4xmQG2aSBsDFFQigbtfJAsS5ieIlWYmlkiSuhk8_t7hssAp2zcnPMkaU7UImCx36Mu7kpwvA_pNksXpvLn6o-QxGLHw7ThkqWJLF7LTbqBmgCHu3l-ni6OB2r8J-AGjx-Fhy_0gNN9YyKJna_9jkwsMxWbVY7jZwSw8sMy7_xmd0bzXcoQKVTwCWJNTOuZfhMjGtuvUE_0FW6x9gG01bjoblKl_aY9SG2RqL6n9DiC9DWioX32DVLjjjLNHQtDAzqfEuBgjJiCjw_X3r-3S_eLjFLH1-t9w9E02bnOKYxSZirfId3Fhhr4SALOJLeWlxAC2Gjbww_I50L_DnKDN2_u4QPKKMhSFX2aVXYHufT5XKfxGnx8Sf3VIZ6GQuHVdTo-zcgMPV7d3wX2diUzKmJtXUKXyOv_yhfMPajQR8PUyQzDqcoKorEW_LUEWqWcML615GmdHwO20JL2LCtCTGlchms-AUP92L9TCa4uhjRD466mG-JT73UByKw5TbWI2FpAPA47QnsHk2BHhyplsqQAFutxv239VPOxQrrPtLCzFj3lFihqxg_XMkhMI63pVjGjP6Qw7ZDg-Idx_1Tlu4xA-0HYwcQ\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA2At8SSJiV4TK9lkhj8UJBcXlq5PrHWrba81QK22CE65m1NypM2NNGqvzp37UVrO5G4kzdQ6O1fSPVqZV32Used7xNg8DNj1Bw0Tz7HojfPwRRcadUB40vV5Ws1MzZ_WNaojVxfx0zLSoivllWvSvxENssc8twqKnkFe7QnmNvRtLiFxmpURTbldF2jfb68zEaOlGuKCWUKKaFquMPe1783yMDnGBDCvyPa3zeepO3z6x-Olua_jFhk8bJDZzfWqn7SjlCf_aDilBdpZNrFqmstdS4OvcLzQcq0vnpVVb57EUblRaXfrXi3qpE2mjjtXDiWaYHjcEGoCai12k16ugIIhTJZD0uApnrwyP5_Zl7Ww9P-PkuihBoRE2RkyZfBpLV4u-TCV4Nu7LzGJHRUVZ6W5C5s3tqdEyizCgcANHL6iQQ_6W5_h-78G3VvAjmAeNUhxTKJsT6iR9VbceJwW5Ocu1IbEHi9uYTPWCqO4pvyg3Tn5BK7G97SAI8lINfoFmsjsJz-wA3j5favW9VUpFoqAhHPJ2M2Es_0hNZaEhwhV9gBQeqjZ36cSdLWGpORUSvTdOOk2Y318RktYrHXM95Msx5rGYJQiS-jY6s36YRB9TzD_0NYwfFzRI29hDhs8Uw8gteF31U_mb3GDZm5G3lby1hcLzNwirfC_MCc6B096i5Ynppjm2P0AIlp1XvssXPUOQrHPUI6\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />"

Most of the hills are rounded, although some cliffs occur in the northern portion of the WSA. John James Gulch and numerous smaller drainages provide topographic screening and create many opportunities for solitude.<br><br>Distant views of Sangre de Cristo and San Juan mountain peaks, across the broad and sparsely-populated San Luis Valley, create a wonderful image of vastness. Vegetation, which is sparse due to the arid climate, consists mainly of low-growing desert shrubs and grasses, pinyon and juniper. Fauna is also sparse due to lack of water, but includes mule deer, antelope, various raptors, and various songbirds. https://www.blm.gov/visit/san-luis-hills-wsa<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA0vWHo3SWs7QBL-1Nu0xansHMghpN1nzm1gvPxZkvgve-H9XUenNAk--UneHj-OFjWo786g2OAUU5m4FdgKIU_3NhMWPUpo__XMuuTkJ7klIloGS7L1DNJ_2KHqPGXc165XwIey84rAU1Eb_ev4ezyr41I00Xq5fuwrTusg0BuuR7bUSC8eoyCQnXh4KB4t6ap8gaFo6yHNBuEXJdA-aBNvEIyqztK53C5CQmsNC6c6YYG2nETr74w0wwiC34hDA8m7KeMbDJlkfTCa2EW8ZY2T5fb4oFMHfT4pOig9MVpogdhqxqRpRCSfyZTDFYWclx8ZEEgLT8JUcRmjfMf7rLP94A4ROiuqnVkcpDny6tahUuO_oIPPYjiyPsZjWCoUy90iXG6bW1HJxU-RrYrkHAvvETOucWtP8RWzVrfOFLIVqCgLq2Ns0ac8Sg-8GFlvrFtTu9k54yUuFRCOif5R-P4Hhd0T-ImJqrbdjtCprYRqcpgnQXbdOQSbwBgtNV_amIVXqgq0w6RHZAutMmRM1M9jkQ43LllcgKr2V3xaxvvaAnhK2rUZ8agNzTcva-Oj2EtDu66kQeCNO1zQVjOHFsOLtJGKBvun2lXmS7NAU8j-LXLzplsfSyw5B6CdQNsN9eBLFOtMn8xTwYyPsDex-mHv8D1GyZr_ppJjyBd3HwLaFRiUyS790GsN1PVzZkzIN2lxMVdTVFAzqQ\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />"

In the summer months a priest from the Sangre de Cristo Parish conducts a Mass, in Spanish, at each local mission church in the area. The community still gathers at the church during Holy Week before carrying a model of the church to San Luis for religious observances. They also gather in July for the Feast of St. James and in December for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.<br><br>https://www.sangreheritage.org/explore/#w2gm-listing-6082"

          "description": "The Sociedad Proteccion Mutua de Trabajadores Unidos (S.P.M.D.T.U.) Lodge Hall in Chama, Colorado was built in ca. 1920. It was considered significant for its contribution to Hispanic history of the state, its adobe construction, and its likelihood to yield important information for prehistory or history. The property was used as a lodge hall for the Hispanic labor union from the time it was built until recently. The S.P.M.D.T.U. is still an active organization in Colorado and Northern New Mexico. The organization was founded to provide mutual aid to its members by pooling their resources to assist one another in times of need.

As the symbolic and actual center of the Viejo San Acacio community, the church and cemetery (capilla y campo santo) are the location for ongoing cultural use and the site of repeated community gatherings since the village formed circa 1850. Additionally, due to representations of a regional folk art tradition as expressed through hand-carved gravestones in the cemetery, it is artistically significant.

It consists mainly of volcanic rocks that form the largest remnant of a major composite volcanic field that covered most of the southern Rocky Mountains in the Middle Tertiary geologic time. Within the region lie an abundance of caldera volcanoes, which comprise the San Juan Volcanic Fields. There are approximately fifteen calderas known in the San Juan Volcanic Fields.<br><br>The region began with many composite volcanoes that became active between 35 and 40 million years ago and were particularly eruptive in the time period around 35-30 million years ago. Around this time the activity changed to explosive ash-flow eruptions. Many of these volcanoes experienced caldera collapse, resulting in the fifteen to eighteen caldera volcanoes in the region today.<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA3ZsLdRM_zfojbzWK7u6NHZdhGUeSVYrsrLeumJvhouKbGBjXGmaVE-zB23UMGqeQ4c1fa14WXeqGcQejkBM2n4F3iMgBjTg3Brf6NsaA03zhIzp2Yvjr5RbWFUwdoU7yO5nBBICwLBBBJ5y7SeI0uDbVB9WdVvROJ2d6eMlrdEDLEHRaZBR7wsHbpZ6vwYRJvx0OtUaLOwSu7mnpAJVY31mPynvCpzdIUwqH8nais-6JRluvQru_nb-jUwGXL1M-tOjkoPiRMaDMrDEqCeMyLJ2mJClFOb32EaqJhdCmHriwi3_1Pp-rmFrH1nB6-n2HBk5bYyMMDiIUOv6yMqnhKRLxtlwOXhHoZbywyC5ZcYSIYKNzTbt3XGyW5uavCRc90Q5NcF0v4BJ272Pk3_ovZz5ceW_BUTuiedFvjkdLW-sCpxHMnBl0nk4UDQ0HQ0PnoSbJCp8aNVEG4U2JEWy9rSKvsJ6RQWmm-HEkcnX3sA8YI7qNdJhI6Uy1WF0-JZWvq7PumDkbDKpCXBFyvQxhbCBO3GJi4UnlYGgndv4lB3h0mpPE3X6GAhAyCSelSvzV7fgPgvk60exWxaxpYVyAx2y_iNuggG_HiQq8yRSDKYgSmfIbFKxqbIFvROKmH1yynKGX0Hf23L6DMYe1Hd7Gl7AFtpK0U3-JJi-ZQ4Y8DbCfX5VNCxn4hXe714kjEfAkUGYwsS5QSSDw\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA2Z__AkI4mSWnYpjMn0YPfNo_-0KXw_od4l6grKWeRLq8z8ey6BFmQKVqBiv6i9KYEt9-hFwSJajbBesM4KP3PM2_CdU0oSmGYJiKE1BtysXGaxEh0d9gw35ER8FmnnGL7-uBDZEbtxmxnDmXWDDPS5IkfVjYvQb2H2V9vKumGhhigex9rdheTevh0ZRFYFL6cVKoJgKtRxgUcXd3_HOykUX1OggDcWwCt1axqTpC6iFaQU9-TjpkgcQIuPcGwawL7O9GqFWzn8RXMIDxfxoHkJteuyWWTfFAUKZSVe-SfDOUSY8DfmSAptYdprTILumpa-Bj0lkGclM7akfB9xjy6G2EGibyzO9LagJF9BfozqZwP5BW5MT4sae7RRk6hnBLtBIgDFgmRbkm0LqS2TvsksORPPYPenoti-DNRQH5agqPOklwvJDigilyUYFBK2km2HST_eQch6yhqzA71TK_wphAzSCZPpYEaz1fya_Okvem1aZRgph9TRxQQWVITasvDp-yI40xfkgsgx1Bqy-EQISVKqAqFAEeaRG6twsxejcU-0JxfufgQd4ZovDJD1lBlQDTjoT1NAfrDKCb6thPQtcIy0-fQ9AHs8Tp3Bm47XYHbt5yF523O-wO4PteH2M1_knT4GA8ywTf86WROm5f3uN4O5v2BoGGYZG8WoM9kZ6UVGDTDR8uc4yTLYA1j1HKpMA01TQZZH\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />"

It, along with fellow bicentennial neighbor Cottonwood Peak, anchors the north-central Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Reigning proudly from its position on the range crest, it's the tallest mountain in the Sangres north of Rito Alto Peak. <br><br>Far from the fourteeners which draw so many to the area, you can find peace and isolation here. Among Major Creek's highlights are groves of tall aspen, numerous beaver ponds, some of which have redirected water onto the trail or even overtaken the trail entirely, and a small natural arch.

The valleys between the plateaus are mostly a winterfat/blue grama short-grass shrub-steppe that provides good habitat for Gunnison prairie dogs.

It sits in the middle of the 77,000-acre Cielo Vista Ranch. Anyone who wants to climb it must make a reservation, show up at the ranch gate promptly at 6 a.m. and present a check to the owner FOR $150.<br><br>While there are plenty of wildflowers down low, you're close to a desert - this mountain is more New Mexico than it is Colorado. Expect lots of pika and marmots, and be prepared for a bear sighting.<br><br>MORE INFO:<br><br>https://www.aspentimes.com/news/colorado-14er-for-sale-buy-culebra-peak-in-the-sangre-de-cristo-range-for-105-million/<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA2ZQX4wKWvK5wwDWRnT8JSwJ1UdEvH02gv65GnZQi9EOsgRyrqzGYL5Z4yE_rItzajNRWOym6tX9IFQWz2RoSb-lQvlpAKMw2OqS-naIDPkb-cPbMgoPsN-yIo_gt3d8UjUb8XPiRA3p9iajH-BoJXdxhh2h4-Sxq6UcChYQ6FHpGHNRgz7hoH3s_zP__y28bF_Nfy4DxK_gBldjX67Bb95TqIWVs9c8L4bpzeOdM05kIA608Bxb-vwrxQuvBG1vP-ZNWAWzcc0wehPJFp2n6C2RN9RZ4vmKS4AG1_plpOhirAXZoXpmhwVVn5MM-jyM25rsIu1eujojkK6_Bv0BDULQrU2OWS8qpINZydOybYa9fD81Tdpo4wuwMrPSTUPG9nvHfZDO7KfZQjLyKXlk52He52tzwvV8SaWz4GHGTXxxXAp05FSyHfXHFLQB0mfdllx4cY6WJgH1UggQU1z4uDri0_j3T3fItLav5wNYyyNk0Lt6uMY2V5u_pXxRrR_u3_1jOY6RTdZVSu4tpwwc3RyuRqgWLSWXg0QY44A9Nlx9v4BW4Ou-po-pEbeKMNxcWjn73UOjl65xlgND1Z7h7IKyRbG5Lj-4rcywTBxoIvHduTi8c5lfPhBIl6fXQyItAo_cMySJcEUrMBZ7mZ5f60B31OsmesJmXrUkn8swMCWcgiE5ZkksTdI2q4tRbsUHhiVC6vE7Hus\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA0P9CKM8H_2p7xc7yRQ6XbIJ457bb9me4SnQZLtY2cFR9VSCBEdkWMK_uh8QFw4gLHaxjdSRJjFOIOkAup9nbpYAm47cdQyWBpmK8tMu1NT2EI5VnK_w7wKEgw5wQczZVu-fPOmbsT06CCaWNhsiowNQQYxh-nG3-s9ZsU_HW68Av5rSW6s4a0NQj_c80EER4swmbJjDH6trJaFatRJ-I6T5YuuYdmhOQHyVZ35sJgIXN5xlLbYmQpzWdYJquX1LufhqALlyGsF9kQJDi7QV0HkISAGU3h8T63_2i-mdLdU_7cv22uGuZBATFaeZuYBNxI3Sq0KQ0dhWK_43Xqw_yuJETX_7B0o9Yk7pbVWmJdhlSmnrt-SSvEJumI5HuAzMrFgrOWNoxXODoQrtHzHcrmOTxBZH0AWAa39-TWo0oXCVxGMNbyGe_mNUphnOqX4a95Q14HJEtHd0OepFlGHueX3M9_jxHWole9EKH6HQ4pNYSCq_9o161Hb708g4iEA-kxppWWcbdOyKEuAqwTVwFJWUK9BiSHnBIFo-eBzA_YFA2RsV6ng2lFhcnr186_zuwTPoE5GDAGP_mIni9Y_Ke-0us6_WYlEUfNOevQDEPaTSP8foxgnkFu9x_Wc5jUcrJS_jgRnRJD4Wv1-tlEbfmnSX0yKM-MUko0xjgFaKxjWihuYmAYauxxdAYK1a0N6WjEdl9CqBN9G\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />"

It is about 11 miles (18 km) northeast of Alamosa on County Road 25. The wetlands had been completely destroyed by pumping and diversion of water for irrigation. Starting in 1965 the Bureau of Land Management began to restore them, and they have become an increasingly important ecological habitat for shorebirds, waterbirds and other wildlife and native plants.<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA0F_xsSAt1_WZ5tSxcvM_qTvSDZbOKWo9p2q-l_affUoPzm3XDaEALQlUJ6ba3RgTQsAqhAcdoFv7Ik5ANErgI7XyO49YkmTFLYeMzzFOtUtSP6HZLkrvesDjZ6GQ3hFvs3QLHZ65Flx77VVoe845MbVbz7NkHAcQNLmu7dfTh5z4C0EdyCk7eKj2ummUKabQf0_vuM8XqoWtCf5qW7chAl4e8Vm2Pt7E3Yh8CirUex6nSQzz01b1BpFUMsJ7hGbV2a6Go2XV6OLzT3ptF8smY8zwRt-ATO8O-DVSvCgBsfgT8Rbr8xBMSoPuz02mGu-U-nRWMuOJR-O5YmpSRVyzF4LvUcSO1STbCwQw9vppQhHEsgIPh-ZiAYsWBQi3y5mLJ9j7j9rFFuBeYHGxGY17dXYM58iUdyVwsnXBpw3CCTC3WS2s4Lt1ZDUp9yBzWamh1OSGgcJgbZF3695ryPKAoTIpsyUMCV-E-U4X_SW7UggtYAb9VuPG-m_kCu8kNRqAT6n9OuhBHr8_tWROascCrf-cNFz3q7xC8JEH_Hyvn9qnwOHt652vL7AuCeQWMYppOXtg9VK7l1o3F02az6SbEnvfYjRPMPdfPAHTE-ryot4lz3xTyKw9HA1auCn5cd7Jywwy5TagfjnJ9NVIt3TM9sZrrzpci4UL_JTfCcyJaAx7c-aeevXcqz4dLx9bzbYWYb8strjnheyQ02XQe3d8pWuPmCWw1RJbT0o98zMMXeJgx26_c18J73RfdTxeGANjDvCYENvt0samHNAem1JnjfVXjSns3fNISONxxr_4pWuAfoeGI07_1ViQA4rbv2DCaX34Z9gKFH9BQZ4FiLe2lADAERTBohjGdx8ThIzm2SfMPIo1zXAuGDwsZRsHuBSO73e8XOtTNMflW3hQVMdTXtjcUMOv54vOb7AXzOhlh_WLZJ_ym11Q7agb-l8jtYhrsqi9jJbRzyUCl5pjsf0DjuWuhvUx5FsF0NTS-uyETJeOsBVfc8iw1fURVdUEKOj7rSeQ\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />"

It is one of the many turquoise deposits which was actively mined by Native Americans for centuries. I.P. King rediscovered the mine in 1890, and the King family has operated it ever since. It was originally called the Lick Skillet Mine. The Manassa turquoise mine produces an incredibly wide range of colors and qualities, from deep emerald greens to deep sky-blue. The best stones feature a rich golden-brown matrix with some spider-webbing.<br><br>The mine is not currently active, so Manassa turquoise is quite rare on today's market.<br><br>https://www.mindat.org/loc-6088.html"

Irrigation includes numerous dikes and other water control structures that provide water to a patchwork of diverse wetland habitats ranging from shallow wet meadows to open water. The refuge includes Artesian wells, pumped wells and irrigation canals, some dating to the \"ditch boom\" of the 1880s. <br><br>The refuge is a major stopover for migrating greater sandhill cranes moving between their wintering area around Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico and breeding grounds in the northern United States and southern Canada. Up to 20,000 cranes pass through in the spring and again in the fall. Three remaining endangered whooping cranes from a failed attempt to establish a wild migratory population in the 1980s can be seen migrating with their foster species, the sandhill crane. <br><br>Beginning in the l980s, a herd of elk began using the refuge. At present, several hundred elk may be seen on the refuge seeking winter food and sanctuary from hunting pressure on nearby public lands.<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA11kRkQ3-4QN1K1MdLzLb2dDi3TPNTHxMgAtA-rbI2h8CD3vr0xaQegAx--f2eGrE-IKh2dRqrOsJPjBPr3SkZebYZHdbAIrf2Zu4QRZHLkX7pG_4xmQG2aSBsDFFQigbtfJAsS5ieIlWYmlkiSuhk8_t7hssAp2zcnPMkaU7UImCx36Mu7kpwvA_pNksXpvLn6o-QxGLHw7ThkqWJLF7LTbqBmgCHu3l-ni6OB2r8J-AGjx-Fhy_0gNN9YyKJna_9jkwsMxWbVY7jZwSw8sMy7_xmd0bzXcoQKVTwCWJNTOuZfhMjGtuvUE_0FW6x9gG01bjoblKl_aY9SG2RqL6n9DiC9DWioX32DVLjjjLNHQtDAzqfEuBgjJiCjw_X3r-3S_eLjFLH1-t9w9E02bnOKYxSZirfId3Fhhr4SALOJLeWlxAC2Gjbww_I50L_DnKDN2_u4QPKKMhSFX2aVXYHufT5XKfxGnx8Sf3VIZ6GQuHVdTo-zcgMPV7d3wX2diUzKmJtXUKXyOv_yhfMPajQR8PUyQzDqcoKorEW_LUEWqWcML615GmdHwO20JL2LCtCTGlchms-AUP92L9TCa4uhjRD466mG-JT73UByKw5TbWI2FpAPA47QnsHk2BHhyplsqQAFutxv239VPOxQrrPtLCzFj3lFihqxg_XMkhMI63pVjGjP6Qw7ZDg-Idx_1Tlu4xA-0HYwcQ\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA2At8SSJiV4TK9lkhj8UJBcXlq5PrHWrba81QK22CE65m1NypM2NNGqvzp37UVrO5G4kzdQ6O1fSPVqZV32Used7xNg8DNj1Bw0Tz7HojfPwRRcadUB40vV5Ws1MzZ_WNaojVxfx0zLSoivllWvSvxENssc8twqKnkFe7QnmNvRtLiFxmpURTbldF2jfb68zEaOlGuKCWUKKaFquMPe1783yMDnGBDCvyPa3zeepO3z6x-Olua_jFhk8bJDZzfWqn7SjlCf_aDilBdpZNrFqmstdS4OvcLzQcq0vnpVVb57EUblRaXfrXi3qpE2mjjtXDiWaYHjcEGoCai12k16ugIIhTJZD0uApnrwyP5_Zl7Ww9P-PkuihBoRE2RkyZfBpLV4u-TCV4Nu7LzGJHRUVZ6W5C5s3tqdEyizCgcANHL6iQQ_6W5_h-78G3VvAjmAeNUhxTKJsT6iR9VbceJwW5Ocu1IbEHi9uYTPWCqO4pvyg3Tn5BK7G97SAI8lINfoFmsjsJz-wA3j5favW9VUpFoqAhHPJ2M2Es_0hNZaEhwhV9gBQeqjZ36cSdLWGpORUSvTdOOk2Y318RktYrHXM95Msx5rGYJQiS-jY6s36YRB9TzD_0NYwfFzRI29hDhs8Uw8gteF31U_mb3GDZm5G3lby1hcLzNwirfC_MCc6B096i5Ynppjm2P0AIlp1XvssXPUOQrHPUI6\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />"

Most of the hills are rounded, although some cliffs occur in the northern portion of the WSA. John James Gulch and numerous smaller drainages provide topographic screening and create many opportunities for solitude.<br><br>Distant views of Sangre de Cristo and San Juan mountain peaks, across the broad and sparsely-populated San Luis Valley, create a wonderful image of vastness. Vegetation, which is sparse due to the arid climate, consists mainly of low-growing desert shrubs and grasses, pinyon and juniper. Fauna is also sparse due to lack of water, but includes mule deer, antelope, various raptors, and various songbirds. https://www.blm.gov/visit/san-luis-hills-wsa<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA0vWHo3SWs7QBL-1Nu0xansHMghpN1nzm1gvPxZkvgve-H9XUenNAk--UneHj-OFjWo786g2OAUU5m4FdgKIU_3NhMWPUpo__XMuuTkJ7klIloGS7L1DNJ_2KHqPGXc165XwIey84rAU1Eb_ev4ezyr41I00Xq5fuwrTusg0BuuR7bUSC8eoyCQnXh4KB4t6ap8gaFo6yHNBuEXJdA-aBNvEIyqztK53C5CQmsNC6c6YYG2nETr74w0wwiC34hDA8m7KeMbDJlkfTCa2EW8ZY2T5fb4oFMHfT4pOig9MVpogdhqxqRpRCSfyZTDFYWclx8ZEEgLT8JUcRmjfMf7rLP94A4ROiuqnVkcpDny6tahUuO_oIPPYjiyPsZjWCoUy90iXG6bW1HJxU-RrYrkHAvvETOucWtP8RWzVrfOFLIVqCgLq2Ns0ac8Sg-8GFlvrFtTu9k54yUuFRCOif5R-P4Hhd0T-ImJqrbdjtCprYRqcpgnQXbdOQSbwBgtNV_amIVXqgq0w6RHZAutMmRM1M9jkQ43LllcgKr2V3xaxvvaAnhK2rUZ8agNzTcva-Oj2EtDu66kQeCNO1zQVjOHFsOLtJGKBvun2lXmS7NAU8j-LXLzplsfSyw5B6CdQNsN9eBLFOtMn8xTwYyPsDex-mHv8D1GyZr_ppJjyBd3HwLaFRiUyS790GsN1PVzZkzIN2lxMVdTVFAzqQ\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />"
